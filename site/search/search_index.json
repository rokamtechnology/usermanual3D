It is possible to reconfigure the Register Locations. This is accessible only for Administrator.</p> <p>COMMUNICATION : It is used to establish a hear-beat kind of communication between the Inspect3D Application and the PLC. For every 5 Seconds, the Application will write the register value as \u20181\u2019 and the PLC will check if the value is \u20181\u2019 or not. If the value is not \u20181\u2019 within the heart-beat time, then PLC can know that there is some problem with communication. PLC also will write the register value as \u20182\u2019.</p> <p>SKUID:  When we need to select an SKU from the PLC, then PLC will write to SKUID Register location with a number (SKUID). Please refer SKU Management to get to know the SKUID of each SKU.</p> <p>SKUID_FEEDBACK: The Application will monitor the SKUID and if the Valid SKUID is read in the SKUID Register location, then the respective SKU will be loaded to the application (all the camera and inspection parameters are loaded and ready to inspect). Once the SKU is successfully loaded, then the SKUID_FEEDBACK register will be written with the same \u2018SKUID Value\u2019 by the Application. Once the PLC will read the same value in the register, then PLC will reset this register to \u20180\u2019.</p> <p>Example : PLC will send the value as \u20185\u2019 to the SKUID register, then Application will look for the load the SKUID which is \u20185\u2019. Upon successful loading of SKU, then Value \u20185\u2019 will be sent back to the SKUID_FEEDBACK Register Location.</p> <p>TRIGGER:  When we need to start the inspection for an object, then PLC will write to TRIGGER Register location with a number \u20181\u2019.</p> <p>TRIGGER_FEEDBACK: Once the Application read this register TRIGGER with value \u20181\u2019, then the TRIGGER Register will be reset with number \u20180\u2019 and TRIGGER_FEEDBACK will be written as \u20181\u2019.
