This option is accessible only to administrators.</p> <p>COMMUNICATION: This is used to establish a heartbeat communication between the Quality Inspection application and the PLC. Every 5 seconds, the application writes a register value of '1', and the PLC checks if the value is '1'. If the value is not '1' within the heartbeat period, the PLC will detect a communication issue. The PLC will then write a register value of '2'.</p> <p>SKUID:  To select an SKU from the PLC, the PLC will write the SKU ID to the SKUID register location. Refer to SKU Management to find the SKUID for each SKU.</p> <p>SKUID_FEEDBACK: The application will monitor the SKUID, and if a valid SKUID is read from the SKUID register location, the respective SKU will be loaded into the application (all camera and inspection parameters will be loaded and ready for inspection). Once the SKU is successfully loaded, the application will write the same SKUID value to the SKUID_FEEDBACK register. When the PLC reads this value, it will reset the register to '0'.</p> <p>Example : The PLC will send the value '5' to the SKUID register. The application will then look for and load the SKU with SKUID '5'. Upon successful loading of the SKU, the value '5' will be sent back to the SKUID_FEEDBACK register location.</p> <p>TRIGGER:  To start the inspection of an object, the PLC will write the value '1' to the TRIGGER register location.</p> <p>TRIGGER_FEEDBACK: Once the application reads the TRIGGER register with the value '1', the TRIGGER register will be reset to '0', and the TRIGGER_FEEDBACK register will be written with '1'. The PLC will receive the TRIGGER_FEEDBACK and reset its value to '0'.</p> <p>CAMERA_STATUS: The application will write the value to the CAMERA_STATUS register.
